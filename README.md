## Description

This React Native app is a minimalist example of app prototyping. It is a fictitious app for planning and displaying events among students at German universities. The app prototype was developed as part of the lecture "Interactive Products & Services" at the Brandenburg University of Applied Sciences.

### 2. Install Expo Cli on your smartphone:
